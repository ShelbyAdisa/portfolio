        <p>Everything I do, I do for you because you are worth every effort, every challenge, and every moment of pressure that life throws my way.<br>
             You are my person, the one I want to talk to after a long and exhausting day, the one I share my complaints and silly jokes with, even when weâ€™re too drained to laugh wholeheartedly. <br>
             Youâ€™re the one who listens as I pour out my thoughts, the one who makes me smile and lifts my spirits when Iâ€™m feeling low. <br>
             Youâ€™re the first person to wish me good morning and the one who checks in during the evening just to see if Iâ€™m okay.<br>
             Youâ€™re the one who crosses my mind when things go right or wrong, the one who understands my moods and handles my frustrations with so much patience and love.</p>
<p>You see me for who I truly am, imperfect and flawed and yet, you love me wholeheartedly, without trying to change a single thing.<br>
     Youâ€™re the one I share everything with my dreams, my fears, my laughter, and my tears.<br>
      The one who stands by me as I work toward my goals and inspires me to be better every single day. <br>
      My love for you is deeper than the ocean, more infinite than the stars in the sky, and greater than every grain of sand on this earth.</p>
<p>I may not say it enough, but I truly appreciate you and all that you do-big or small.<br>
     I admire the incredible man you are and the one you are becoming.<br>
      I know without a doubt that youâ€™ll be an amazing father when we start a family.<br>
       I love watching you grow, achieve, and succeed in everything you put your mind to.<br>
        You are my greatest blessing, and I hope you never forget just how much you mean to me.<br>
         I am so proud and so lucky to be yours.
I love you more than words could ever say.</p>
Happy Valentines Day, my love. ðŸ’–
